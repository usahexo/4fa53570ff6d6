As it turned out, they were almost knocked out of the World Cup in their first game – against minnows Tunisia.</p>
<p>In that game, the Italians only managed to score one goal and that was an own goal by Tunisian defender Dylan Bronn. This left them needing at least a draw in their last game against Group G favourites England in order to qualify for the next round. In that last game, they were behind 1-0 until the 92nd minute when midfielder Mario Balotelli equalized with a header from a cross delivered by fellow substitute Ciro Immobile. This gave Italy a chance to win the game in extra time, but they were unable to do so and so the match went to penalties.</p>
<p>Italy had never lost a World Cup penalty shoot-out before, but this changed as they lost 4-3 to leave them exiting at the group stage for the first time since 1958. This was seen as a national disaster in Italy and there were calls for coach Gian Piero Ventura to be sacked. One of the criticisms of Ventura was that he didn’t put his best players on the pitch in the final group game against England.</p>
<p>This criticism may have some validity as goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon (who has announced his retirement from international football), defender Andrea Barzagli, midfielder Marco Verratti, and forward Lorenzo Insigne all started on the bench. It should be noted though that these players are all experienced veterans who have taken part in many previous World Cup campaigns.</p>
<p>One player who did start against England was striker Mario Balotelli who had been playing well for French club Nice since joining them from Liverpool in 2016. Balotelli had been left out of Italy’s Euro 2016 squad by Ventura and so he was keen to make an impact in this World Cup. In fact, he had set his sights on being top scorer at the tournament.</p>
<p>Balotelli didn’t get off to a good start as he missed two good chances in the match against England. However, he redeemed himself by scoring the equalizer late on and then converting his penalty kick in the shoot-out. After this match, Ventura said “I am proud of him [Balotelli], because he is proving that he can fight back”.</p>
<p>So given that Balotelli is now scoring goals again for his country – including one against Saudi Arabia last week that clinched their place in next year’s tournament – it seems likely that Ventura will select him for Italy’s opening game of the World Cup against Australia next June. This should give Australia’s defence something to worry about as Balotelli is not only a physical threat but also has good technique and can score goals from long range too</p>

<p>Napoli’s billionaire owner, Aurelio de Laurentiis, flew in two Ainsworth Game Technology (AGT) EagleSlots machines to the club’s training ground this week in a last-ditch effort to encourage his players and help them recover from their 5-0 drubbing by Real Madrid in the Champions League last 16.</p>
<p>Prior to the game, De Laurentiis had been a vocal critic of his team’s lacklustre performances, but he is now hoping the addition of the two AGT machines will motivate his players to win the Italian Cup and qualify for next season’s Champion League.</p>
<p>Napoli’s head coach Maurizio Sarri is also said to be a fan of slot machines, and he is hoping that the presence of the two AGT machines at the training ground will help improve his team’s fortunes on the pitch.</p>
<p>AGT is one of the world’s leading suppliers of slot machines, and it has provided its gaming equipment to some of the biggest casinos around the world. The company is also a major supplier of gaming equipment to online casinos, and it has developed a number of popular online slots games that are enjoyed by gamers all over the world.</p>
<p>In addition to its range of slot machines, AGT also supplies gaming tables and other casino equipment to casinos around the world. The company has a large team of experienced engineers who design and build its gaming products, and it has a strong reputation for manufacturing high-quality gaming equipment.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-fix-a-slot-machine-–-SSC-Napoli-turn-to-Victorian-gaming-manufacturer-for-salvation"><a href="#How-to-fix-a-slot-machine-–-SSC-Napoli-turn-to-Victorian-gaming-manufacturer-for-salvation" class="headerlink" title="How to fix a slot machine – SSC Napoli turn to Victorian gaming manufacturer for salvation"></a>How to fix a slot machine – SSC Napoli turn to Victorian gaming manufacturer for salvation</h1><p>SSC Napoli have been left with a broken slot machine and are looking for help to fix it. The club has turned to Victorian gaming manufacturer, Aristocrat, in the hope of salvaging their season.</p>
<p>The Napoli slot machine, which was purchased before the start of the season, has not been up to scratch since day one. Players have complained that they have not been able to win any money on it and club officials decided that it was time to seek help.</p>
<p>“We were hopeful that the new machine would bring us good luck but it’s been nothing but trouble,” said a club spokesman. “We thought we’d give Aristocrat a try and hopefully they can get our machine back up and running.”</p>
<p>Aristocrat are no strangers to fixing broken slot machines and were more than happy to offer their services. “We’re excited to be working with SSC Napoli and we hope we can get the machine up and running as soon as possible,” said a company spokesman. “It’s always great to help out a football team in trouble.”</p>
<h1 id="Italian-club-SSC-Napoli-seek-help-from-Aussies-to-fix-slot-machines"><a href="#Italian-club-SSC-Napoli-seek-help-from-Aussies-to-fix-slot-machines" class="headerlink" title="Italian club SSC Napoli seek help from Aussies to fix slot machines"></a>Italian club SSC Napoli seek help from Aussies to fix slot machines</h1><p>Italian football club SSC Napoli have enlisted the help of some Australian entrepreneurs to fix their slot machines. The Aussies are said to be providing technical advice on how to improve the payout rate on the machines, with the hope of increasing profits at the club.</p>
<p>One of the Aussies involved in this project is Anthony Butera, a Sydney-based businessman who owns an online gaming company. Butera is reported to have Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis as a business partner, and it is understood that De Laurentiis asked Butera for help with the slot machines.</p>
<p>Napoli are not the only Italian football club seeking assistance from Australian entrepreneurs. In June last year, Serie A side AC Milan announced that they had partnered with an Australian company called Lottoland to offer betting services on their matches.</p>
<p>This trend of Italian clubs turning to Australia for help seems to be growing, with Serie B side Avellino recently announcing that they had signed a partnership agreement with an Australian sports marketing agency. It’s clear that there is a lot of interest in Australia when it comes to football, and Italian clubs are taking notice.</p>
<p>The announcement about Napoli’s new partnership was made earlier this week, and it’s hoped that the relationship will help the club become more profitable. It will certainly be interesting to see how things progress between SSC Napoli and their new Australian partners.</p>
<h1 id="Slot-machine-fiasco-forces-SSC-Napoli-to-seek-expert-help"><a href="#Slot-machine-fiasco-forces-SSC-Napoli-to-seek-expert-help" class="headerlink" title="Slot machine fiasco forces SSC Napoli to seek expert help"></a>Slot machine fiasco forces SSC Napoli to seek expert help</h1><p>In a season blighted by disappointing results on the pitch, things have now taken a bizarre turn for SSC Napoli after their slot machine fiasco.</p>
<p>Last week saw the club forced to seek expert help in order to resolve an issue with one of their slot machines, which has been resulting in players being unable to withdraw any winnings.</p>
<p>The problem emerged when it was noticed that the machine was paying out more than it should be, with some unlucky punters walking away with thousands of euros they shouldn’t have had.</p>
<p>This soon led to chaos as other players realised they could exploit the situation by making multiple small bets in the hope of winning big, only for the machine to then refuse to pay out.</p>
<p>Club president Aurelio De Laurentiis was unsurprisingly less than impressed, and has since called on the help of a specialist engineer who will hopefully be able to get the machine working again as it should be.</p>
<p>Napoli’s season has been desperately poor so far, with just one win in their last six games leaving them languishing in mid-table.</p>
