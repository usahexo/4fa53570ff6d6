#  How To Level Up Your Beehive Slot Machine & Get More Gems!

So you've decided to conquer the Beehive Slot Machine! This guide will help you get the most out of your slots and earn more gems in the process.

First and foremost, it's important to understand the concept of "leveling up" your machine. Essentially, each time you play the slot machine and achieve a new result, your machine is "leveled up" by one. The following chart illustrates the different levels and their corresponding gem payouts:

Beehive Slot Machine Levels and Gem Payouts:

Level Gem Payout 1 100 2 150 3 200 4 250 5 300 6 350 7 400 8 450 9 500 10 550 11 600 12 650 13 700 14 750 15 800 16 850 17 900 18 950 19 1000

As you can see, leveling up your machine increases the amount of gems you can earn for each spin. As such, it's important to do everything possible to level it up as quickly as possible. Here are some tips on how to do just that:

1) Play the slot machine regularly. The more you play, the faster your machine will level up.

2) Use bonus coins whenever possible. Bonus coins give you an immediate increase in your machine's level, which leads to bigger gem payouts.

3) Strategize your spins. Try to aim for results that will move your machine up to the next level. For example, if you're on Level 4 and spin for a result of 400 or below, you won't progress to Level 5; but if you spin for a result of 401 or higher, you'll move up to Level 5. It's all about aiming high and maximizing your gains!

4) Refer friends and family members to the game. When they sign up through your referral link and play the slot machine, they'll automatically receive a bonus increase in their machine's level – giving you an edge in progressing even faster!
