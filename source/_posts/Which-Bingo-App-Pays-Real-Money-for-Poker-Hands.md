#  Which Bingo App Pays Real Money for Poker Hands?

There are many different bingo applications that are available for players to use these days. However, not all of them offer the opportunity to win real money. So, which one pays out when someone wins a poker hand?

One such application that does allow for real money payouts is Bingo Bash. This app is available for both Android and iOS devices. It has been designed by GSN Games and offers a number of exciting features for players. These include bingo cards, slots games, and of course, poker hands.

In order to qualify for a payout when playing poker on Bingo Bash, players need to first purchase poker chips. These chips can be purchased in denominations starting at $1 up to $500. Once players have acquired some chips, they can then start playing the game’s poker hands.

The minimum bet that is required in order to play a poker hand is 10 chips. The maximum bet, however, is 500 chips. So, if someone wants to bet the maximum amount on any given hand, it will cost them $2,500!

There are six different types of poker hands that can be played on the app: two pairs, three of a kind, straight, flush, full house, and four of a kind. If players are lucky enough to get any of these hands while playing poker on Bingo Bash, they can then go on to win real money payouts.

The amount that is paid out for each hand varies depending on the type of hand that has been won. For example, getting a two pairs pays out 3x the amount of the player’s bet, while getting a four of a kind pays out 1000x the amount of the player’s bet! So, there is certainly potential to make some serious money while playing this exciting game on Bingo Bash!
