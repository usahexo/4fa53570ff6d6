#  Wolfsburg stake their claim as Poker's top dogs 

Wolfsburg are the new Poker's top dogs.
They have won the last 5 major tournaments and are currently on a winning streak that shows no signs of stopping.

The main reason for their success is their very balanced team. They have players who can win any given hand, which gives them a lot of options when it comes to playing the game.

Their captain, Philipp Gruissem, is one of the best poker players in the world. He has already won over $10 million in his career, and he shows no signs of slowing down.

Gruissem is supported by a strong team of players, including Liv Boeree, Fedor Holz and Igor Kurganov. These players have helped Wolfsburg to become one of the most feared teams in Poker.

Their recent victory at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) proves that they are a force to be reckoned with. The WSOP is the biggest and most prestigious Poker tournament in the world, and Wolfsburg dominated it this year.

This victory means that they are now the official Poker champions of the world. No other team can rival their supremacy at this point.

Wolfsburg's next goal is to win back-to-back World Series titles. This would cement their place as Poker's top dogs and ensure that they remain at the top of the sport for years to come.

#  Wolfsburg make strong statement at poker table 

Wolfsburg are one of the Bundesliga’s most well-funded clubs, and they made a statement over the weekend by winning the German Poker Championship. The event, which took place in Berlin, was a €1,000 buy-in tournament and Wolfsburg’s team of Christian Kruk, Tobias Hausen, Stefan Kiefer and Jörg Müller outlasted some 558 other players to take home the title.

This was no fluke victory - Wolfsburg have been one of Germany’s most successful poker teams for years now. In fact, they have now won four German Poker Championships (2007, 2010, 2013 and 2017).

What makes their latest triumph even more impressive is that it was achieved during a time when poker is not as popular as it once was. The global downturn in the economy has seen many people lose interest in poker, but Wolfsburg have continued to churn out success after success.

So how do they do it? What is their secret?

Well, there is no magic formula - it really is just down to hard work and dedication. These guys play online poker as well as live tournaments and they put in the hours studying the game and learning new strategies. They also have a great team spirit, which helps them when things get tough during long tournaments.

The result is a team that is both highly competitive and highly effective. They know how to win games and they know how to handle themselves under pressure. This combination of skill and attitude has seen them crowned champions on numerous occasions, and there is no reason to doubt that they will continue to be a force to be reckoned with in the years ahead.

#  Wolfsburg dominate poker scene, leaving rivals in the dust 

Wolfsburg have pulled clear in the poker world, leaving their rivals behind in the poker dust.

The Wolves have been simply unstoppable this season, with a string of tournament wins and deep runs. Their latest victory came at the PokerStars Barcelona Festival, where they scooped €1.5 million in prize money.

This latest triumph follows hot on the heels of their win at the partypoker MILLIONS Germany €10,000 Main Event. The Wolfsburg squad was led by Christoph Vogelsang and Dominik Nitsche, who both final tabled the event.

Nitsche was also victorious in the coveted $100,000 High Roller event at the festival, taking down an impressive $1.7 million payday. This was his fifth High Roller title in 2018 alone, cementing his reputation as one of the game’s most accomplished players.

Vogelsang is also having a stellar year, with over $3 million in earnings so far. The German pro is currently ranked 5th on the all-time money list with over $20 million in career cashes.

Wolfsburg’s dominance has come as a surprise to some observers, who had expected rival teams such as Barcelona or London to be leading the pack. However, with so many top talent plying their trade for Wolfsburg, it seems they are destined to remain at the top for some time to come.

#  Wolfsburg show they're a Cut Above the Rest in Poker World 

The 888poker’s Wolfsburg Edition live event was a massive success, with $1,000,000 in prize money on offer. The action took place in the Wolfsburg Stadium from 14-17 December and some of the world’s best poker players turned out to compete.

In the end it was Nick Petrangelo who walked away with the lion’s share of the spoils, taking down first place and the $333,333 top prize. But there were plenty of other big winners at the event, with Christian Christner (2nd), Dominik Nitsche (3rd), Fedor Holz (4th) and Stefan Schillhabel (5th) all finishing in the money.

Interestingly, Holz and Schillhabel both missed out on winning their first World Series of Poker bracelet this year but they both now have a Wolfsburg Edition title to their name. They are also the only two players to have ever won three different major titles - WSOP bracelets, World Poker Tour titles and now a Wolfsburg Edition title.

The final table was certainly a star-studded one, with some of the biggest names in poker competing for the top prize. But Petrangelo proved himself to be the man to beat, eventually defeating Christner heads-up to take home first place.

888poker’s Wolfsburg Edition proved to be an amazing success, attracting some of the best players in the world and offering up an enormous sum of prize money. There’s no doubt that this is going to become one of the most popular events on the calendar and we can expect even more big names turning out for next year’s edition.
