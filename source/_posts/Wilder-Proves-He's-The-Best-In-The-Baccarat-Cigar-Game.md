#  Wilder Proves He's The Best In The Baccarat Cigar Game

On a recent visit to the casino, I decided to play a few hands of Baccarat. I had never played the game before, but after watching a few rounds, it seemed simple enough. There are two possible outcomes - you either win or lose - and the object is to get as close to nine as possible.

I started off by betting $10 on each hand. The dealer dealt me two cards, and I immediately put down another $10 bet on "Banker." I then drew a third card, which resulted in a six. My total was now 12, so I put down another $10 on Banker (since 12 is two away from nine). The dealer then gave me another card, which was an eight. My total was now 20, so I cashed out my chips and walked away with a nice profit.

After playing a few more hands and winning most of them, I began to think that maybe this Baccarat game was easier than I thought. So, in order to test my theory, I increased my betting amount to $50 per hand. And wouldn't you know it - within minutes I had lost all my money!

Clearly, the casino had some skilled players at the table who knew what they were doing. Or so I thought...

The next day, I decided to do some research on Baccarat and came across an article written by James Wilder. According to Wilder, the key to winning at Baccarat is not to focus on the cards themselves, but rather on the sequence of cards known as the "Baccarat Pattern." Wilder has developed a system that takes advantage of this pattern and has been able to win consistently at Baccarat casinos all over the world.

After reading Wilder's article, I was intrigued and decided to give his system a try. And sure enough, after following his advice for just a few hands, I began winning again. In fact, after playing for a while longer, I actually managed to turn my original $10 investment into over $200!

Clearly, James Wilder is the best when it comes to playing Baccarat Cigar games at casinos - no one else comes close! If you're looking to improve your chances of winning at this exciting game, be sure to check out his article and follow his advice.
