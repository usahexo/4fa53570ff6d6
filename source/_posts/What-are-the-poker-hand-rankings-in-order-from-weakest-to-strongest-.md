#  What are the poker hand rankings in order from weakest to strongest? 

In poker, the strength of a hand is usually ranked from weakest to strongest based on the probability of the player receiving a winning hand. The weakest hand would be two pair, followed by one pair, then high card. The strongest hand would be a royal flush.

Here are the rankings of poker hands in order from weakest to strongest: 

2 Pair 
1 Pair 
High Card 
3 of a Kind 
Straight 
Flush 
4 of a Kind 
Full House 
Straight Flush 
Royal Flush

#  What is the highest ranking card in a poker hand? 

The ace is the highest ranking card in a poker hand. This is followed by the king, queen, and jack; then the ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, and three. The deuce (two) is the lowest ranking card.

#  How many different possible five card hands are there? 

There are 52! or 2,598,960 different five card hands.

#  What is the probability of being dealt a particular hand? 

There are 52 possible cards in a deck, so there are 52!/51! = 2,598,960 different hands that can be dealt. 

This means that the probability of being dealt any particular hand is just 1/2,598,960 or about 0.000039%.

#  If two players have the same five card hand, who wins?

If two players have the same five card hand, who wins? The answer to this question is not as straightforward as it may seem. In some cases, the player with the highest-ranking card will win. However, in other cases, the player with the lowest-ranking card will win. 

In order to determine the winner in a situation where two players have the same five card hand, it is necessary to compare the suits of the cards. If both players have the same suit, then the player with the higher-ranking card within that suit will win. If both players have two cards of the same rank, then the third card is used to determine the winner. 

For example, if Player A has a five of clubs and Player B has a five of spades, then Player A will win because their club is higher than spade. If both players have a jack of diamonds, then the ace of clubs will be used to determine the winner – since it is higher than any other club in either player’s hand.
