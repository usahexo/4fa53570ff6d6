#  Enter at Your Own Risk: The First Vegas Casino Wilder is a Gamble

Today, the first casino opened in Las Vegas. It was called the Nevada Club and was located on Main Street downtown. The casino offered a variety of games, including poker, blackjack, faro, and roulette.

The idea for a casino in Las Vegas came from William Larimer, Jr., who had been involved in gaming operations in Colorado. In 1905, he formed the Las Vegas Land and Water Company with the intention of developing a town in southern Nevada. The company purchased land near the current downtown area and began selling parcels to people who wanted to move to the area.

Larimer also wanted to create a destination for entertainment and gambling and saw Las Vegas as the perfect place for it. He believed that southern Nevada’s hot climate and proximity to California would make it attractive to people looking for an escape from the cold winters in the north.

The Nevada Club was not the only casino in Las Vegas at the time. There were also several other small casinos located on Fremont Street. However, the Nevada Club was the first one to open its doors after prohibition ended in 1933.

At its opening, the Nevada Club was considered a wild and dangerous place. Many people thought that it was too risky to gamble there because it was possible to lose all your money in a single night. In fact, some people referred to it as “the suicide club” because of how easily you could lose your money there.

Despite these risks, the Nevada Club proved to be popular with gamblers and soon became one of the most successful casinos in Las Vegas. In fact, it remained open until 1978, when it was closed down due to competition from newer casinos in the city.
