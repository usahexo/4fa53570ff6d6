This game is a variation of the classic card game known as Solitaire. It involves creating stacks of cards in ascending order, from Ace to King.

Some tips for playing Einstein's Game of Kings include keeping track of which suits have been played and avoiding building sequences on temporary piles.

#  Einstein's Winning Strategy for King Income Games

In the early 1900s, when Einstein was working as a patent clerk in Bern, he often played a game called King Income with his colleagues. The game is simple: there are two players, each with 10 coins. One player starts by flipping one of their coins over, and the other player has to guess whether the next coin flipped will be heads or tails. If they guess correctly, the first player gets to keep both coins; if they guess incorrectly, the first player loses both coins.

Einstein's strategy was to always choose heads. This may seem like an obvious strategy, but it's actually quite clever. If you always choose heads, you'll win 50% of the time (assuming that both coins are fair). If you choose tails, your chances of winning are only 25%. So by always choosing heads, Einstein was more likely to win more games and earn more money.
